JC Tools v3 - Unlock All Skins
Powered by Maas Devs

We built JC Tools v3 to create an extension of the older version which has limited features. Inspired by MS iTools, we have developed this app with the help of the data and source code we have bought from sources.

Disclaimer! We have used some resources/materials that we don't own. All rights reserved, belongs to the owner specially for Mobile Legends.

Purpose:
The main purpose we built this application is to test skins before buying in the shop. Also, to help users experience the skins visually in their device only if there's no trial card for that particular skin. We recommend buying the skins in ML shop. All skins we provided are just temporary and sometimes it displays weird bugs.
